This site is designed for training and testing purposes to strengthen our trainees' understanding of their learning modules. As part of Project SAKSHYAM, it is our responsibility to ensure that our trainees become truly "SAKSHYAM" â€” not only excelling in their respective domains but also becoming capable of contributing to their families' financial well-being.
